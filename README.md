# XenoForums App
## How this app works
Essential I hooked into the feeds at http://xenoforums.16mb.com/index.php?forums/-/index.rss for new posts and http://xenoforums.16mb.com/index.php?forums/main-forum.2/index.rss for latest news. I also used https://www.youtube.com/user/ItsFrosttyGames for the YouTube section. The staff list is manually updated but the avatars are not.
## Installation
To install clone this repo and run the powershell script in the install folder. This app is currently only compatible with Windows 10.
## Compiling
In order to compile this you must use Visual Studio 2015. Please note that the Youtube API key located in ` ```XenoForumsApp.Source-v1.0.1.0/XenoForumsApp.W10/Sections`` to one generated at Google Developers Hub. A guide can be found at https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started (read the before you start section!)
## About
